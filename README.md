# Refactoring-Challenge-01

Client is requesting to replace all non-semantic tags with semantic ones in both the HTML and CSS files and to also condense repeated code.

Changes made:

    In the index.html file:

        I updated the proper div tags to include header & nav semantics

        In the body, I updated the div tags to include the section& article tags.

        Next, I reclassified the div tags for the side section with the aside semantics.
    
        Lastly, I updated the final div tags to include the footer semantics.

    In Style.CSS file
    
         I condensed all benefit declarations into a single selector element for margin-bottom & color attributes.

        I condensed all benefit h3 declarations into a single selector element for margin-bottom & text-align attributes.

        I condensed all benefit img declarations into a single selector element for display, margin, and max-width attributes.

        I condensed all content declarations into a single selector element for margin-bottom, padding, height, font-family, background-color, and color attributes.

        I condensed all content image declarations into a single selector element for max-height attributes.

        Lastly, I condensed all content h2 declarations into a single selector element for margin-bottom and font-size attributes.
